//! `breathe-retirada-ci` — retirada's spot-reclaim signal, applied to
//! job-shaped (CI) workloads.
//!
//! **Vendored verbatim from `pleme-io/breathe`'s `breathe-retirada-ci`
//! crate (2026-07-23).** Both `pleme-io/breathe` and `pleme-io/pangea-operator`
//! are private repos, so this repo's own default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot
//! `git clone` `breathe` to reuse its crate directly — that would need a
//! new cross-repo PAT, deliberately not introduced (same reasoning as the
//! `pleme-io/hardened-images` and `pleme-io/autorevivy` ports). This is a
//! straight port of the decision core + its full test module, unmodified
//! logic; only this note and `.github/workflows/retirada-ci-watch.yml`'s
//! own comments describe what's specific to THIS repo's deployment.
//!
//! **Evidence gate for this repo (2026-07-23):** `release.yml`'s own run
//! history on `camelot-builder-pleme-eks` shows **92** `cancelled`
//! conclusions total — by far the largest count of any repo checked in
//! this rollout. A systematic sample of 20 of those 92 (the `container
//! image → ghcr.io (camelot-builder-pleme-eks / override)` job, the one
//! `release.yml` job actually routed to `camelot-builder-pleme-eks`) shows
//! `runner_id: 0` for the job's entire observed lifetime AND a
//! created→completed duration of EXACTLY 24h00m00s (±1s) in 20/20
//! sampled runs — the textbook GitHub queue-timeout signature, identical
//! to the two previously confirmed incidents (`pleme-io/breathe` run
//! `29930406877`, `pleme-io/hardened-images` run `30007679929`). A
//! smaller number of this workflow's cancelled runs show much shorter
//! durations (seconds to a few minutes) consistent with a human
//! cancelling a stuck-looking run during active debugging rather than
//! GitHub's own timeout — those are the SAME zero-runner-assigned root
//! cause caught early, not a different failure mode. No `concurrency:`
//! group exists on `release.yml` that would explain the 24h-exact
//! cancellations as an ordinary push-supersede.
//!
//! **This repo's own `release.yml` DOES expose a `runner` workflow_dispatch
//! input**, but neither of its two real values is a safe redispatch
//! target: `ubuntu-latest`/GitHub-hosted fails outright on this PRIVATE
//! repo under the org's billing/spending-limit gate (documented in this
//! repo's own `ci.yml`), and `rio-build-01` is PERMANENTLY retired
//! (2026-07-20 operator decision, never coming back). So, like the
//! `hardened-images` and `autorevivy` ports, the deployment workflow
//! forces `--dry-run=true` unconditionally (report-only) — there is no
//! live redispatch destination to point at.
//!
//! `theory/BREATHABILITY.md`'s `retirada` names the drain-ahead signal
//! for REPLICA-shaped workloads: `breathe-control::replica` scales a
//! replica set OUT ahead of a pending spot reclaim, covering the
//! doomed replicas before they're lost (§ `spot_reclaim_pending` in
//! `breathe-control/src/{replica,lifecycle}.rs`). A CI job has no
//! floor to scale out ahead of — it's one attempt, not a replica set —
//! so the job-shaped sibling of retirada is necessarily reactive, not
//! preemptive: classify why the job's runner pod disappeared, and for
//! exactly the legitimate-reclaim case, retry that ONE job on the
//! existing on-demand runner override.
//!
//! A GH Actions job that fails because its runner pod's node was
//! legitimately reclaimed by the auction ether (breathe's
//! predict→optimize→auction decision layer, `breathe-auction`
//! nee `breathe-spread`) is a distinct, typed failure class from a
//! genuine break in the job's own steps — this crate classifies which
//! is which and, for the legitimate-reclaim class ONLY, decides the
//! one remediation: redispatch that job, escalated onto the
//! already-existing on-demand runner tier (e.g. `pleme-io/breathe`'s
//! own `image.yml` `workflow_dispatch.inputs.runnerOverride`,
//! `ubuntu-24.04` — never a fresh spot pool for the retry, which would
//! just re-enter the same reclaim dynamics that caused this).
//!
//! **Corrected 2026-07-23, against real evidence, not assumption.** The
//! first version of this crate modeled ONLY [`PodExitCause`] — a runner
//! pod that started, then got evicted mid-job. Two real, independently
//! diagnosed incidents the same day (`pleme-io/breathe` run
//! `29930406877`, `pleme-io/hardened-images` run `30007679929`'s
//! `verify-aarch64-build` job) turned out to be a DIFFERENT failure
//! mode entirely: the GitHub Jobs API showed `runner_id: 0` /
//! `runner_name: ""` for the job's ENTIRE lifetime — no runner was ever
//! assigned, not once, until GitHub's own 24h queue-timeout
//! auto-cancelled it. Neither incident was a mid-job spot reclaim; both
//! were pure capacity starvation (the amd64 pool couldn't keep up for
//! 24h straight; the org's only arm64 runner was offline). See
//! [`QueuedJobObservation`]/[`classify_queue_starvation`] — the
//! confirmed-real failure mode this crate has actually observed in
//! production, needing only the GH Jobs API (no k8s RBAC at all,
//! unlike the pod-eviction path below). [`PodExitCause`] remains
//! modeled (a real mid-job spot reclaim is still a real possibility)
//! but is UNCONFIRMED against any actual incident so far — don't round
//! it up to "the" failure mode; it's "a" failure mode.
//!
//! **Tier-honest (2026-07-23): the typed decision cores are real and
//! tested against mocks for both failure modes.** The pod-eviction path
//! ([`ClusterObserver`]) has no production implementation — a real one
//! needs RBAC to watch pods in the ARC runner namespace, a live-cluster
//! decision needing explicit operator go-ahead. The queue-starvation
//! path ([`JobQueueObserver`]) needs only the GitHub Jobs API + a GH
//! token with `actions:write` — the SAME credential already used
//! throughout this repo's own CI — so it is realistically deployable as
//! a plain scheduled GitHub Actions workflow, no cluster access
//! whatsoever. Still not deployed as of this commit — [`WorkflowDispatcher`]
//! has no production implementation either — but the deployment blocker
//! for THIS path is materially smaller than the pod-eviction path's.
